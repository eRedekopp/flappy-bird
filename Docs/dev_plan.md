Development plan for Flappy Bird project

## Goals

1. Implement a "Flappy Bird" clone with the pygame library
2. Use machine learning to automatically play the game

## Iterations

### Phase 1: Complete

A window is opened, and a yellow dot sits on the ground in the centre
of the screen

### Phase 2: Complete

The yellow dot changes colour when the user presses the space bar

### Phase 3: Complete

Add physics and jump when user presses space bar (no longer changes
colour)

### Phase 4: Complete

A green bar of random length is on the screen next to the dot, attached
to the bottom of the screen

### Phase 5: Complete

The screen scrolls, generating new bars on the bottom of the screen as
it goes

### Phase 6: Complete

Generates a bar from the top of the screen as well as the
from the bottom, in pairs

### Phase 7: Complete

Detects when the yellow dot comes into contact with a green bar, and
ends the game when it happens

### Phase 8: Complete

Keeps track of the player's score and displays it at the end of the game

### Phase 9: Skipped

Aesthetic changes as desired, smooth out entrance and exit of bars on
screen

### Phase 10

Use machine learning to automatically play the game (exact steps TBD)
