## an explanation of the physics in flappy_bird.py

dt = the time in seconds for one frame
y = the y position of the bird
v = the y velocity of the bird
a = the y acceleration of the bird
g = acceleration due to "gravity"

Acceleration stays constant at g; choose a value that feels good

Velocity is the integral of acceleration with respect to time, so dv = g * dt
Velocity is updated every frame and jumps discontinuously when the bird jumps.

y is the integral of velocity with respect to time, so dy = g * dt^2. Position
is also updated every frame and is used to decide where to draw the bird in each
 frame
